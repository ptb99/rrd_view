# rrd_view
Django server to view RRD charts from voltage logger

This is intended as a complete package to turn a Raspberry Pi into a simple
data logger (using an ADC, such as on the Pimoroni Automation pHat).

Currently, this just handles the web server to display charts from RRD that
have been recorded by the other components.
